# Project Structure
Application code resides in the `lib` directory

By convention, there's a folder with the same name as a the project in the `lib` directory. For example, if the project is called `A`, the project structure of `A` will be `lib/A`. This folder sits alongside an `A.ex` file in the `lib` directory.

Modules are namespaced within the folders. If for example, there's a file in the `lib/A` directory called `B.ex`, the module in that file should be defined as:
```
defmodule A.B do
    # some code here
end
```

# Elixir map
```
%{ key: value, .... }
```

# Implicit Returns
The last expression evaluated in a method is implicitly returned

# Pipe Operator
The result of the function on the left is passed as the first argument to the function on the right
```
b = foo(a)
c = bar(b)
d = baz(c)
```
can be rewritten as:
```
foo(a)
|> bar()
|> baz()
```
or as 
```
foo(a) |> bar |> baz
```
or as 
```
a |> foo |> bar |> baz
```
